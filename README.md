I am a Computer Science Student looking for Software Engineer jobs.

With this repository I intend to keep track of my problem solving process and hopefully help others to become better problem solvers.

I will start by pushing easy problems with various solutions stating their time and space complexity. I will also make comments on how to approach the problems.

Follow me on my journey to becoming a Software Engineer at a top company!
